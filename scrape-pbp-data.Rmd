## Project Introduction 👋🏽

My intent was to explore process mining techniques on the NBA final, to that end I web scraped the play by play (pbp) data, cleaned and combined until realising. The data is not in the write format to use process mining...gutted. In an effort to make sure my time wasn't a total waste. I've uploaded the data on Kaggle and posted this here script. Hope someone finds it remotely useful. For the curious, to see the process mining analysis see `link`

### Load Custom Functions

```{r load_custom_functions}

# Gets dates from scorebox
get_scorebox_date <- function(pbp_html){

 pbp_html %>% 
 html_nodes("div.scorebox_meta") %>% 
 html_children() %>% 
 pluck(1) %>% 
 html_text() %>% 
 strptime(format = "%I:%M %p, %B %d, %Y", tz = "UTC")

}
 
# Retrieves the rows for each quarter
get_quarter_row_indicies <- function(pbp_raw){

 ## Get row references for quarters
 quarter_1_row_location = 3:(which(pbp_raw$X1 == "2nd Q") -2)
 quarter_2_row_location = (max(quarter_1_row_location) +5):(which(pbp_raw$X1 == "3rd Q") -2)
 quarter_3_row_location = (max(quarter_2_row_location) +5):(which(pbp_raw$X1 == "4th Q") -2)
 quarter_4_row_location = (max(quarter_3_row_location) +5):(nrow(pbp_raw) -1)
 
 quarters_list <- list(quarter_1_row_location, 
                       quarter_2_row_location, 
                       quarter_3_row_location, 
                       quarter_4_row_location)
 
 ## Get min and max rows references for each quarter
 row_references <- data.frame(
  min = map(quarters_list, ~min(.x)) %>% unlist(),
  max = map(quarters_list, ~max(.x)) %>% unlist()
 )
 
 return(row_references)
 
}

# Filters play by play data and adds relevant quarter
add_quarters_col <- function(pbp_raw) {
 
 quarter_rows <- get_quarter_row_indicies(pbp_raw)
 
 q1_pbp <- pbp_raw[quarter_rows[1, "min"]:quarter_rows[1, "max"], ] %>% mutate(quarter = "q1")
 q2_pbp <- pbp_raw[quarter_rows[2, "min"]:quarter_rows[2, "max"], ] %>% mutate(quarter = "q2")
 q3_pbp <- pbp_raw[quarter_rows[3, "min"]:quarter_rows[3, "max"], ] %>% mutate(quarter = "q3")
 q4_pbp <- pbp_raw[quarter_rows[4, "min"]:quarter_rows[4, "max"], ] %>% mutate(quarter = "q4")
 
 pbp_with_quarters <- bind_rows(q1_pbp, q2_pbp, q3_pbp, q4_pbp)
 
 return(pbp_with_quarters)
 
}

# Gets gameday team names
get_team_names <- function(pbp_raw) {

  team_names <- pbp_raw[2, c(2, 6)] 
  
  return(team_names)
 }

# Calculates cumulative timestamp
calc_timestamp <- function(pbp_with_quarters, scorebox_dates){

 ## Requires scorebox dates
 scorebox_date <- as.Date(scorebox_dates)
 
 pbp_with_timestamp <- pbp_with_quarters %>%
 rename(timestamp = X1) %>%
 mutate(
  timestamp = lubridate::ymd_hms(
   paste0(scorebox_date, " 0:", timestamp)
  ),
  ## Calculate time difference using timestamp
  timediff = if_else(
   is.na(lag(timestamp, 1)),
   as.numeric(timestamp - timestamp),
   as.numeric(lag(timestamp, 1) - timestamp)),
  ## Calculate cumulative time difference using timediff
  timediff = seconds(cumsum(timediff)),
  timestamp = lubridate::ymd_hms(
   scorebox_dates + timediff
  )
 )

return(pbp_with_timestamp)

}
```

### Scrape Data

```{r scrape_data}

# Read play by play html
pbp_html <- list(
  pbp_2024_06_06 = read_html("https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/202406060BOS.html") 
 ,pbp_2024_06_09 = read_html("https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/202406090BOS.html")
 ,pbp_2024_06_12 = read_html("https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/202406120DAL.html")
 ,pbp_2024_06_14 = read_html("https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/202406140DAL.html")
 ,pbp_2024_06_17 = read_html("https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/202406170BOS.html")
)

# Get scorebox dates
scorebox_dates <- map(pbp_html, ~get_scorebox_date(.x))

# Read roster html
roster_html <- list(
 bos_roster = read_html("https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2024.html"), 
 dal_roster = read_html("https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DAL/2024.html")
) 

```

### Transform Roster Data

```{r transform_roster_data}

# Transform roster data
roster_raw <- map(
 ## Get roster table and convert to data frame
 roster_html, ~html_element(., "table") %>% 
                    html_table()) 

# Add team names to roster data
roster_raw$bos_roster["team_name"] <- "Boston Celtics"
roster_raw$dal_roster["team_name"] <- "Dallas Mavericks"

# Cleaning columns
roster_data <- roster_raw %>% 
 bind_rows() %>% 
 janitor::clean_names() %>% 
 rename(number = no, 
        birth_country_code = birth, 
        experience = exp)

datatable(roster_data, class = c("compact", "hover", "row-border"),  rownames = FALSE)

```

### Transform PBP Data

```{r transform_pbp_data}

# Transform pbp data
pbp_raw <- map(
 ## Get play by play table and convert to data frame
 pbp_html, ~html_element(., "table") %>%
                         html_table(header = FALSE))
 
team_names <- map(
 ## Get team names, switches depending on who's home
 pbp_raw, ~get_team_names(.)
 ) %>% 
 bind_rows()

pbp_with_quarters <- map(
 ## Select rows with times only and add quarter column
 pbp_raw, ~add_quarters_col(.x)) %>% 
 map(~tibble::rowid_to_column(.x, var = "order"))

 pbp_with_timestamp <- pmap(
 ## Calculate cumlulative timestamp
 list(pbp_with_quarters, scorebox_dates), ~calc_timestamp(..1, ..2))
 
 pbp_finals_data <-  pmap(
 ## Rename columns
 list(pbp_with_timestamp, 
 pull(team_names[ ,1]), 
 pull(team_names[ ,2])), 
     ~rename(..1,
             "{..2}_play" := X2, 
             "{..2}_score_tally" := X3, 
             "score_board" := X4,
             "{..3}_play" := X5, 
             "{..3}_score_tally" := X6)
     ) %>% 
  bind_rows()

datatable(pbp_finals_data, class = c("compact", "hover", "row-border"),  rownames = FALSE)

```

## Reproducibility 🔂

I attempt to make a habit of coding functionally and with reproducibility in mind. However, for this project I only needed the final 5 games of the 2024 NBA final. As such, for those wanting to reuse code to scrape other games, please check: - List names for object `roster_html` - In code chunk `transform_roster_data` the team names have been manually added
